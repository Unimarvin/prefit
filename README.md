# prefit
PREservation oF InTegrity constraints.

PreFIT is a tool that computes
non-preserving steps of colored Petri nets regarding a specification of referential integrity. The main purpose of the development of PreFIT is to create
visibility and reproducibility of research results presented with reasonable runtime. PreFIT accepts files from CPNTools, a
widespread tool for modeling with data-aware Petri nets.

The tool is part of the phD thesis "Preserving data integrity in distributed systems" written by Marvin Triebel.
